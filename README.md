# Description

This is just a learning exercise. It's basically a translation of the [Mike Bostock's example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/517fdb49f959cb1461e2) 
to Objetive-C. The algorithm could be found in [this paper](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf).

**disclaim: This is one of my very first Objetive-C Projects, so the code is completely messed up.**
